take-home assignment: string parsing problem regarding unique number combinations, moderate-hard difficulty depending on your coding level.

coding challenge which was pretty easy. string manipulation.

were around data structures

i was being asked with data structure problems

some tree, trie, hashmap.design calculator

describe one of your technical projects in depth

design a rudimentary api

basic binary tree problem

design a way to check if a specific 10-digit number is in use or not

design a chess game

Dynamic programming, but it wasn't too tough

determine if a given tree fulfills all requirements to be a binary search tree and write code to test.

Standard algorithms and data structures. nothing out of the ordinary

lottery question around uncle morty's choices

// TODO:
1) maintain string class and support certain API operations => need to try more string manipulation problems
2) autocomplete
3) two sum, two sum cloest
4) DFS, BFS => treasure island or similar
5) Tree travrsal => have review those classic tree related problems
