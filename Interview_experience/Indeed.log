I applied for a job on Indeed.com and for Indeed. An internal recruiter contacted me and suggested another job that would be a good fit. She worked very hard to help me feel confident in the interview process. I had 2 phone interviews and then an onsite.

The phone interviews were a little technical and to see my thought process. The onsite interview consisted of some white boarding for technical questions and talking about how I would go about certain business questions/projects. Everyone was helpful and seemed to want to see me succeed which made it less stressful than other interviews I've had.

My final interview was a phone call with the CTO. He took an interest in my unique background and was willing to work with me to find a good project if I took the job.

Interview Questions:

What would I use to incentivize a deal between Indeed and an e-learning company.

==============================================================================================================
Interview

The full hiring process takes place over a few weeks. First there is a small half-hour interviewer with your recruiter. If that goes well you proceed to 2 online videochat interviews. One covering business questions, and the other covering coding questions. If you proceed from here, next is an onsite interview which they will provide transportation for. This session is 3 hours long and consist of another business interview, coding interview, personality interview, and lunch. Finally, if you proceed from here you will have a phone call with a higher-up. A few days after the call I was told I wouldn't be receiving an offer.

==============================================================================================================
Two rounds of video interview.
One related to coding and ML concepts and the other related to product development.

However, the second video interview is not like people reported.
All the questions are related to real products they are trying to build.
It seems more like they are trying to collect ideas from applicants.
No feedback after the rejection.
Totally not recommend!

Interview Questions:
How to detect fake review from user

==============================================================================================================
Interview

Initially contacted by a recruiter. Had a phone call to discuss the position and my interests.

First round: Video Call Technical interview - 2 programming 1 open ended question

Second round: Video Call Business interview - Questions about improving Indeed

Third round: Onsite - 2 Business interviews 1 Technical interview, similar to previous rounds.

Final round: Phone interview with senior hiring manager - Questions about previous experiences.

I was notified about the final offer the day of the final round phone interview.

==============================================================================================================
Interview

I had a phone interview with HR. Got into the second round, in which I expected easy coding questions as per the reviews on Glassdoor. The experience was really horrible. Firstly the zoom video platform didn't work. Secondly, it was live coding on codility which was really unexpected as I wasn't informed about earlier. The questions were really tough considering this role.

Interview Questions:

Recursion questions based upon some conditions. Didn't get a chance to look at the second question.

===============================================================================================================
Interview

1. Initial Recruiter call, basic introduction on this role;
2. Technical Interview with technical problems, mainly about algorithms and maths;
3. Business Interview with business models;
4. onsite, repeat 2 and 3, in total one technical + two business;
5. CTO call, discuss resume and business model

===============================================================================================================
Interview

The recruiters were not very organized and it took multiple follow-up emails to ever get a response.

I was told that my first interview would be with a business person, but it was actually a coding interview. I did ok without any coding preparation, and the interviewers (current Technical Business Analysts) said they'd recommend me for the next interview.

My second interview was a product interview. At the end, the interviewer (current… Show More

Interview Questions:

Two Leetcode easy-level programming questions and a data classification question.
Answer Question
"How would you detect fake reviews", 
"What metrics would you develop to compare Indeed to Glassdoor", 
"How would you design an app for gig workers"

==============================================================================================================
Interview

It was via a zoom call, and I was asked some string manipulation questions and some data science related stuff. The questions weren't too hard if you prepare for the questions listed in other Glassdoor reviews.

==============================================================================================================
Interview

The people I spoke to were nice but the process was very slow. About a week in-between every round of interviews. Phone screen, technical interview, another technical interview, flying out to their campus and a bunch of in-person interviews, then another phone screen a week later? 5 weeks total. I was told at the very start it'd take two weeks start to finish. Overall I'm pretty disappointed in how they…

Interview Questions:

How do you classify high dimensional dataset?

===============================================================================================================
Interview

I got first phone call interview, the hiring manager asked me 2 simple algorithm question and 1 data analysis problem. It's really quick and not difficult. You just need to clarify how you think. If you have any question, just ask hiring manager.

Interview

Applied online from Indeed and received called from Recruiter in one week and arrange the called with the Hiring Manager for one hour technical interview over Google hangout. The interview went well with series of technical questions and coding test over the call. But the Hiring Manager rejected me over the call itself as they were looking for someone with more than 5 years of experience.

Interview Questions:

Ask me to change the code such that the time complexity of the code is reduced?

Interview

Was contacted originally by HR from Indeed on Indeed Prime, the compensation seemed really lack luster for the position but I figured I'd move through the process just to get some more interview experience and see if I changed my tune during the interview process.
 HR person asked some questions, introduced me to the role & company. Set up an interview for the technical portion.
I had told the technical interviewer at…

==============================================================================================================
Interview

I was contacted by a recruiter in mid November of 2018. She told me to give her dates for the end of November to interview but set up a phone interview a month later at the end of December. The first phone interview was a technical interview regarding algorithms and data structures - typical stuff you'd see in a software interview. I passed this stage and the recruiter called me immediately to schedule a follow up phone interview.

The second phone interview was a business interview in that they asked about Indeed's business model, competitor analysis, and product improvements. After the interview, the interviewer told me I'd hear back in a day or so.
Fast forward 2 weeks and I still don't have any feedback. The person who interviewed me was not the person that was listed in the scheduling email. I emailed the recruiter about this and she didn't seem to know that I had already finished my interview and who it was that actually interviewed me. She told me she'd get back to me with feedback. A few days later, she told me there was feedback and scheduled a phone call with me but never called. I emailed her to follow up but she did not respond to that either. She eventually got back to me with a no, and said I needed a deeper knowledge. However, this was unexpected as the interview feedback I got during the interviews was that I did well.
The entire experience just seemed very unprofessional and a waste of time considering it took from November to January for 2 phone interviews, followed by weeks of waiting and a missed meeting by the recruiter. This is especially apparent as I was going through the Google interview process and onsite at the same time. The Google process and recruiters were just so much more on the ball.

=================================================================================================================
Interview

The interview process took 4+ weeks and went something like this:
1. A 30-45 minute phone call from the recuiter who described the position, asked how long it would take to relocate if offered the position, and asked what my minimum salary requirement would be.
2. A 30-45 minute Google Hangouts technical interview with a Technical Business Analyst on the team. Consisted of 2 computer programming and 1 data analysis question
3. A 30-45 minute "business sense" Google Hangouts interview with another Technical Business Analyst on the team. This was basic questions about Indeed and competitors.
4. Flight to onsite interviews (there were 3 of them plus lunch)
4a. 45 minute "product" interview with current Project Manager
4b. Another 45 minute "product" interview with another current Project Manager
4c. Lunch with a Technical Business Analyst on the team
4d. 45 minute technical interview with a Technical Business Analyst on the team. 2 computer programming questions (This one was horrible because he had NO clue how to phrase his questions and was completely confusing himself as well we me!) This guy had literally NO business conducting interviews.
5. Final phone call interview.

==============================================================================================================
Interview
I applied for the business intelligence team through the University Career Fair. The recruiter was quick to get back with a take-home test on data analysis. This was followed by a phone interview in the next week. I spent time doing a good job on the take-home test and one thing I did not like about the interview was that the interviewer had no clue about my take-home test (they asked questions again).

Interview Questions:
How will build a model to predict the price of real-estate? How will you verify it works?

==============================================================================================================
Interview
First round with a hiring manager. Second round technical phone screen.
The first round is okay because the hiring manager will look through your resume and talk about your experience and value you'll bring.
But the technical screen is not that good. It's share screen coding challenge. Some python questions and SQL questions. The python is not that hard since you can actually execute your code and alter it if you made some mistake. The SQL test, you can't execute. The interviewer will tell you where you write wrong, and they give you chance fix mistake.
I didn't get a call back after the technical screen. In all the interview is not hard. But the feedback I got from the coding interview is really terrible. It's like a high school teacher judging my hand writing. Like I tried to type something but delete them a few seconds later. Or I tried to solve a question using a method they don't is necessary.
My advice, if you're fresh out of school. This might be the right interview process to go through. Just make sure you type every line of your code correctly on the first try. Otherwise they'll give you a very subjective negative feedback.
If you're experienced, this may not work out well because they don't care your value and thought process.

Interview Questions:
A python share screen question.
Several SQL questions which can be very challenging.

==============================================================================================================
Interview
Chaotic and wildly unorganized. I was desperate for interviews at the time and was basically doing the recruiter's job with multiple follow-ups, after which they would schedule another video interview. I believe I had 3 total.
Then radio silence after the recruiter said they would schedule an in-person after the holidays. That never happened.
Apparently Indeed.com runs like a frat house with "managers" being in their late-twenties. This explains their low Glassdoor…

Interview Questions:
How would you go about designing a promotional mug for Indeed?

==============================================================================================================
Interview
Received a message from recruiter. Was mildly interested so I proceeded. Phone screen followed by technical 1 on 1 interview with current business analyst. It was overall easy interview but somehow I wasn't invited for the onsite. Because of NDA, not allowed to submit Interview Questions: here, but generally an easy interview; however, the job description and required technical skills weren't well described nor communicated with recruiter. I was not expecting algorithm questions, where I think I might have missed off. Statistics questions were on easy side for me as I am a trained statistician.

==============================================================================================================
Interview
Contacted by the recruiter, after a short talk with recruiter. I was Phone interviewed. the question is for string find. and I answered by KMP. The interviewer is very nice.

Interview Questions:
string find
==============================================================================================================
Interview
The interview process was the following:
- Phone screening with an Indeed Recruiter
- Phone interview with 2 members of the hiring team; 1 was only a shadow
- Video interview with a manager belonging to a key stakeholder group
- On site interview for a total of 6~ hours across 4 interviews, a workshop, and lunch.

Interview Questions:
What would you do without limitations of time, talent, or money?

==============================================================================================================

Interview
Hiring process consisted of a phone screening, coding question assignment which was to be completed in a week and then onsite interview. The interview was two hours long and consisted of three different stages.The whole process took about three weeks from initial contact.

Interview Questions:
Coding question was to analyze hospital record data from and excel file and display it. Very routine, not difficult.

Onsite interview was 2 hours long and consisted of a simple programming interview (eh: string reversal). An abstract thinking question and regression question.
