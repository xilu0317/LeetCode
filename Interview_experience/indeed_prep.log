what is your hardest challenge at Sophos and how did you overcome it
Situation:
Sophos is a cloud-based software company specializing in firewall solutions. In our product CWG, we provide users with up to min live loggings for cilents' network traffics. The endpoint agent => Netguards (funnel servers) geo => backend server hosted on AWS for further data processing (for example, removing PPI and sharding) and then send to Hadoop so users will be able to see. In the process, the logs were delayed by ours of in some cases days.

Task:
Find out investigate why the logging has high latency.

Actions:
Given the humongous scope of the project, we were struggling 

Result:
Resolve the task and deployed our fixes so that logging services are almost rendering in real time in Sophos Central.

2) challenge of constant context switching
Situation:
Being at the end of sprint that I need to be pulled away for CWG firefighting.

Task:
Provide urgent hotfixing to patch security holes. After the task, get back to XG feature development and used my weekend to ultimately produce a testable iso for our QAs.

Actions:
succesfully indentified the problem and provided the hotfixes in zookeeper cluster.

Results:
The security team were satisifed with our tentative actions.

what is your career goal in five years
Becoming a product manager and a decsion maker for a product that I will be prond of.
Strategization of products has long been my career aspriations. Currently, my font line dev experience could prove to be
highly valuable when it comes to accure my experience needed to be succesful.

What is your strength?
Generalist with training outside the scope of the project. 
I belive I can always bring values and insights from other domains which is a curcial 

Stress tolerant
Frequently work under very demanding conditions where stakes are always high because the nature of the production impact. 

Extraordinary multitasking ability
Being a memeber of two teams of CWG and XG, I have to constantly switch between two Teams.

Extraordinarily inquistive about new things and ideas even if those are outside of my domain

What is your weakness?
Lack of concentration of specialization.
Being a full stack engineer, it means the person should be a well rounded in the entire stack of the technogy.
I never had the training or oppurnity to horn very deep skills in technology.

How about personal trait flaws:
I indulge myself in social media which is something I will look to avoid in the future.
Sometimes I find it hard to articulate certain thoughts becuase the limitation of my English.
