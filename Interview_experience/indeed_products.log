Indeed:
- started as a job aggregator
- main focus is a job board

cons:
lack of interaction like Linkedin
lack of user base for reviews

Linkedin:
- professional social networking platform
- It has job posting

Glassdoor:
- company review platform

What would I use to incentivize a deal between Indeed and an e-learning company?
- implement a commission to share the profit between indeed and the 3rd party company
- offer rebates to the partner to consume paid indeed services at a discounted rate
- commence a partner incentive program

What metrics would you develop to compare Indeed to Glassdoor
- number of total jobs
- types of jobs
- avaiablity of geo locaitlity

How would you go about designing a promotional mug for Indeed?
-core idea is to promote visbility as well as 'infestivity'
- shape: to capture people's attention, a strange geometrical shape would be benefical but there is a trade of between the shape and its utility
- color: distinct color such as red or orange so that people's attnetion will be immediate captured
- texture: unique textures enough to stop passers-by to stare at the target and paying attention
- utility: improved ease of use would promote the likelyhood of the target to be carried around
- combination of all above
